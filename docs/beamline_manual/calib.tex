\section{Collecting calibration spectra}

Any source with spectral lines in the energy range of interest can be
used for calibration. At the time of this writing, we are calibrating
all detectors with three sealed sources: $^{55}$Fe, which has spectral
lines at 5.9 and 6.5 keV; $^{57}$Co, with a line at 14.4 keV; and
$^{137}$Cs, which has a line at 32.2 keV.
